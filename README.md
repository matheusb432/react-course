# react-course

'React - The Complete Guide' course studies

## Contents

- Folders have been enumerated in the order of which they were added

- Folders with a `00-` prefix contain the most important contents

- With exception of some lectures which were necessary to be in JavaScript, all of the course's code was written in TypeScript, even though the course itself was written in JS.

- Starting in section 04, all stylesheets were written in Sass CSS

## Notes in Code

- To visualize notes right next to their example implementations that are scattered throughout this repository, I'd recommend using the VS Code extension `Todo Tree`, and then just filter for any comment with a `NOTE` prefix to it.

  - e.g. `// NOTE This contains a note`

- You can also just search for `NOTE` (case sensitive and with one whitespace afterwards) in the IDE of your choice and it should show every note in the project.
